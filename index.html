                 Growing up I spent my early years living in Dallas, Texas. For majority of those years I was raised by my step-father who was a discharged veteran of the Army.
                 This taught me to pay attention to things that most people wouldn't think would be necessary to note. As I got older, I learned to become very proficient with
                 noticing details and patterns that helped me when it mattered, especially when I played basketball and soccer. Right before middle school, we moved to Oklahoma to be 
                 around family. During my senior year of high school, I was offered a scholarship to play soccer at the University Of Southern Nazarene. I played there for two years 
                 before moving my focus to academics by attending Bryan University in Tempe, Arizona to finish my Bachelor's degree in Science. Later, in 2022, I found my true passion
                 and decided to join a 24-week bootcamp to learn how to help design, create, and update new software with earning my certificate in Software Development from DevCode.

                    After graduating from college, I immediately starting working as a personal trainer and running my own business as a contract trainer working out of a nearby gym
                    facility. I trained for almost 7 years as a part-time trainer and one year as a full-time trainer before moving into the insurance industry as a sales agent.
                    I thought since the money would be promising that once I get my license as a insurance agent I would be set but, no one told me about the cold-calls, the long 
                    unpaid hours because it was full commission, the door-to-door footwork, and the amount of stress that is put upon you to sell. I immediately looked for better ways
                    to use my license with different companies until I was able to find a work-from-home tele-sales company that sold medicare. 
                    
                     
                    The training was long and boring but it was consistent hourly wages that was more than I had ever made. I stuck around through that position until I could get out of the sales department and
                    work more on the administrative side. Now, I have been working as a Broker Service Representative for the last two years and during that time, I was educated on
                    what Software Development was all about. I was referred by a co-worker at the time to look into the website Udemy and try a course he recommended. Once I completed
                    my first course, I fell in love with the database, the analytics, and the meticulous depth of the work. So I bought more courses and decided that this is where I 
                    want to be! However, I needed a faster and better structured way of breaking into the software industry.

                    I have played sports all my life. Growing up in Texas, you probably can guess that I played football and it was my favorite sport. I also played
                    basketball when football season was over. I actually did not start playing soccer until I was eleven years old which was right before we moved
                    to Oklahoma. Since then, I grew to love playing basketball and soccer more than football. I stopped playing football after middle school due to
                    the high school I attended did not offer any sport but basketball. I continued playing soccer in recreational leagues and helped my high school
                    create a soccer team during my sophmore year but we were really bad and barely had enough players so we had just one co-ed team play against
                    all-boys teams. We learned quickly that this was not a good idea and did not have a soccer team the following years.
